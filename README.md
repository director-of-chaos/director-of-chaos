## 👋🏽 Hey, I'm konfushon

I'm the kind of developer who looked at smart contract security, said "cool, but what if we went deeper?", and promptly disappeared into the cryptographic rabbit hole. Six months later, I came out yelling about zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation and I haven't shut up since.

I'm a cybersecurity engineer, applied cryptography developer, bug hunter, and (recently) part-time food tech founder. I like building things that are private by design, secure by default, and *ideally* usable without a PhD.

----------

### 🔐 What I Do (these days)

-   **Applied Cryptography** – I build apps with ZKPs, MPC, and FHE. I don't invent cryptographic primitives, there are people smarter than me who do that, I wire them into systems that solve real privacy problems.
    
-   **zero knowledge proofs + multi party computation** – Exploring architectures where heavy computation happens off-device, results come back with a zero-knowledge proof, and no one touches your private data in between.
    
-   **Smart Contract Security** – I spent 2+ years deep in the Ethereum trenches: auditing contracts, contesting, responsibly breaking things and contributing to one of the [most starred smart contract vuln repos](https://github.com/kadenzipfel/smart-contract-vulnerabilities) out there. These days I drop in less often, but I still keep a close eye on how the space breaks itself.

### 🧠 Hacker Mode

-   Cofounder of [p3rf3ctr00t](https://perfectroot.wiki/) — the **top-ranked CTF team in East Africa.** I specialize in blockchain, cryptography, and web challenges.

-   Occasionally write CTF challenges for platforms like [ctfroom](https://www.ctfroom.com/) and DefCon — mostly blockchain and cryptography puzzles.
    
-   Web2/Web3 bug bounty hunter with a research-driven mindset — I like tactics that involve reading papers, writing scripts, and breaking assumptions. If a whitepaper says "assume element X is safe", I don't.
    
-   I build things and test them on the toughest reviewer I know — my girlfriend. If she doesn't get it, I redesign it. If she does, we ship it.

### 🛠️ Things I'm Building

-   **A cryptography dev company** (name redacted for now) — goal: bring practical privacy tooling into everyday workflows. It'll probably do something important and private, unless I get distracted by some new zk thing.
    
-   **Chiko** – A peer-to-peer Kenyan recipe marketplace. Think of it as OLX for food ideas — from local homes, not global kitchens. Local food is so underrated.
    
-   **Hackathon Experiments** –
    
    -   Presented a privacy-preserving ML model using FHE via [concrete-ml](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml) that predicts diseases without leaking user symptoms — [won a Safaricom + Huawei hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/YdKopfJPJ_o?si=YjP1H2NEZir20uto&t=6319).
        
    -   Also won the **HUSTLE EXPO 2024** hackathon with a slightly less encrypted idea (but still awesome).

### 🗣️ Side Quests

-   I've given cybersecurity talks to over 500 people — and surprisingly, most of them stayed awake.
    
-   I contribute to open source, particularly in [smart contract vulnerability research](https://github.com/kadenzipfel/smart-contract-vulnerabilities) (how bugs happen, why they matter, and how not to repeat them).

> "Human dignity demands that personal information, like medical and forensic data, be hidden from the public. But veils of secrecy designed to preserve privacy may also be abused to cover up lies and deceit by institutions entrusted with data, unjustly harming citizens and eroding trust in central institutions. Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems are an ingenious cryptographic solution to this tension between the ideals of personal privacy and institutional integrity, enforcing the latter in a way that does not compromise the former."
